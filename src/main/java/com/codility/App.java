* For example, given N = 2, A = [29, 50], B = [61, 37],

C = [37, 70], the function should return 3, since there are three ways to stop: (29, 37, 70),

or (29, 61, 70), or (50, 61, 70). The first triplet means that John can stop for salad at the

29th kilometer of his travel, for pizza at the 37th kilometer, and for cake at the 70th kilometer.

Given N = 2, A = [29, 29], B = [61, 61], C = [70, 70], the function should return 8, since there

are two ways of choosing each of the stops, making it 2*2*2 = 8. Given N = 1, A = [5], B = [5],

C = [5], the function should return 0.
