CODILITY
————————

The repo is for the solutions of the problems in the Codility platform. Codility problems
are mathematical in nature and helps to improve the abstract thinking. However, unless
specified, these problems may not be suitable to prepare for the general coding interviews.

I haven't write the solutions and are primarily collected for the educational purpose.
However, I refactored the code and changed the logic if necessary. Occasionally, I don't
find the solutions over online and write them myself. Obviously, These solutions are free
to use.

I will attain some tournament and update the repo overtime.
