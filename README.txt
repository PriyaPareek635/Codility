CODILITY
————————

The repo is for the solutions of the problems in the Codility platform.

I haven't write the solutions and are primarily collected for the educational purpose.
However, I refactored the code and changed the logic if necessary. Occasionally, I don't
find the solutions over online and write them myself. Obviously, These solutions are free
to use for learning purpose.

I will attain some tournament and update the repo overtime.
